# Matrix (WOP)
Small project to help people do some matrix magic in their C projects.

Remember: Matrix using dynamic arrays.
Functions are splitted in two groups: return new matrix, or override origin. I think you'll understand what it was made for.

P.S. No build needed, just load .c/.h files to your project!
