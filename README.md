# Matrix (WOP)
Small project to help people do some matrix magic in their C projects.

Matrix project is based on OOP but in C, so you can use Matrix struct to get access to it's functions. Unfortunatelly, struct size is little bit huge, maybe i'll fix it later. Remember: Matrix using dynamic arrays.
Functions are splitted in two groups: return new matrix, or override origin. I think you'll understand what it was made for.

P.S. No build needed, just load .c/.h files to your project!
